# Philosophy

## Determinism
The engine is deterministic. Runtime behavior must be reproducible and auditable.

## Reality-First Documentation
Documentation is authoritative. If runtime behavior diverges, the runtime is wrong.

## Domain Neutrality
The core runtime is domain-blind. Domain knowledge exists only in modules, schemas, data, and manifests.

## No Mock Data
The system does not use mock data to define or validate behavior.

## Separation of Concerns
The kernel is protected from UI, domain logic, and host/platform responsibilities.
