# Documentation Index

## Purpose
This documentation set is the authoritative description of the HSB Engine architecture. It is not a proposal.

## How to Read
1. Start with `philosophy.md` for system principles and constraints.
2. Review `architecture-overview.md` for the layer model and data flow.
3. Use the remaining documents as scoped references for specific subsystems.

## Structure
Each file is atomic and non-overlapping. If a change affects system behavior, the related document must be updated first.
