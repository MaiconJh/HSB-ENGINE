# Runtime Contracts

## Deterministic Execution
All runtime flows must be deterministic, reproducible, and free from AI or nondeterministic inputs.

## Contract Surfaces
- Kernel-to-module interfaces define extension points.
- Module-to-UI outputs are read-only and presentation-safe.

## Status
Contracts are not implemented yet; this document defines intent only.
