# HSB-ENGINE

HSB Engine is a deterministic modular execution platform. It executes isolated modules, orchestrates independent processes, persists real data, and observes runtime behavior with auditable signals.

## What This Solves
The engine provides a stable, domain-neutral core that can expand indefinitely through modules, schemas, manifests, and interfaces without modifying the kernel.

## Documentation
The authoritative documentation lives in `docs/` and is split into scoped, atomic files. Start with `docs/README.md` to follow the intended reading order.

## Status
This repository contains documentation and scaffolding only. No runtime logic is implemented here.
